  |   Inspired by turn-based strategy games of the past, TINY METAL takes   |

  |   brings it into the modern era with great graphics, 15 unique units,   |
  |   and never-before-seen gameplay mechanics. TINY METAL is the           |
  |   Japanese arcade war game you wish you had as a kid.                   |

  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.1.1 (v262144).                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This patch comes with a wide range of fixes, changes and new          |
  |   content. The most noticeable update is that the opening cinematic     |
  |   has been replaced by a more traditional loading screen. Balancing     |
  |   changes have been made to many units, and all units can now be        |
  |   healed in friendly structures - before it was limited just to         |
  |   infantry units.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A selection of new skirmish maps - including "Split Fire," "Sea of    |
  |   Trees," and "Abandoned Park" - have been introduced as well, and      |
  |   the Metalpedia has been updated with new lore. These alterations      |
  |   are paving the way for the much-hyped multiplayer patch.              |
